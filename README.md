# Crypto-Currency-Insights-Real-Time-Data-Pipeline

🚀 Project Purpose & Expected Outputs

🎯 Purpose
This project is the culmination of everything I learned during my Data Engineering Bootcamp. My goal was to:

Design, develop, and deploy a fully operational, cloud-based data application using production-grade tools.

Implement end-to-end data engineering concepts—from ingestion to transformation to analytics—in a real-time environment.

Apply advanced data modeling techniques using Delta Live Tables (DLT) to manage streaming data.

Provide actionable insights for crypto traders by analyzing live order book and ticker data from Coinbase.

I wanted to build something that wasn’t just academic—but felt like a real product someone in the industry would actually use.

📈 Expected Outputs
The key outputs from this project include:

✅ Real-time KPIs computed from live Coinbase API data (top 5 cryptocurrencies).

🧠 Intelligent trading signals such as:

Buy vs Sell intent

Whale wall detection

VWAP (Volume Weighted Average Price)

Order book depth analysis

📊 Auto-refreshing dashboards built on Databricks to monitor trading behavior over 30-second and 24-hour cadences.

🔍 A production-ready data pipeline using:

Apache Spark

Delta Lake + DLT

Parquet-based raw storage

Continuous ingestion with schema enforcement

🛡️ Built-in data quality checks for schema consistency, value sanity, and dataset completeness.
