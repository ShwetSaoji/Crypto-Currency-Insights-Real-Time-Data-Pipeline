## ‚úÖ Project Steps

### 1. Define Scope & KPIs

- Selected 5 coins: **BTC, ETH, ADA, SOL, DOGE**  
- Finalized KPIs: Buy/Sell Intent, VWAP, Whale Walls, etc.

### 2. Ingestion Layer

- Used `ThreadPoolExecutor` for parallel API calls  
- Saved raw JSON data as **Parquet** files every 10 seconds  

### 3. Bronze ‚Üí Silver ‚Üí Gold

- **Bronze**: Raw ingestion  
- **Silver**: Schema enforcement, enrichment (notional value), quality checks  
- **Gold**: Aggregations every 30s and 1d for dashboards  

### 4. Real-Time Dashboards

- Created per-symbol views with VWAP, Whale Walls, etc.  
- Dashboards auto-refresh every 30 seconds

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Challenges & Solutions

| Challenge                        | Solution                                                          |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Missed asks in initial ingest    | Appended both sides of order book with proper labeling            |
| File explosion from small writes | Used partitioning + `coalesce(1)` to optimize writes              |
| Schema drift from API changes    | Leveraged `_rescued_data` for error handling and schema evolution |
| Real-time aggregations lagging   | Designed DLT logic to always reprocess with checkpoints           |
| Cross-coin dashboard clutter     | Shifted to **symbol-specific dashboards**                         |

## üîç Data Quality Checks

### ‚úÖ Enforced via `@dlt.expect_or_drop`

- **Price**: Not null, > 0  
- **Size**: Not null, > 0  
- **Side**: Must be in `['buy', 'sell']`  
- **Symbol**: Must be in the set: BTC-USD, ETH-USD, ADA-USD, SOL-USD, DOGE-USD  

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Monitored via `@dlt.expect`

- **Price Ranges** (e.g., BTC: 10K‚Äì1M, DOGE: 0.01‚Äì1.5)  
- Helps detect anomalies without dropping rows
